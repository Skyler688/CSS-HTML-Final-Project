        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          A desert biome is a type of ecosystem characterized by dry, arid
          conditions with very little rainfall—typically less than 10 inches (25
          cm) a year. Deserts can be hot, like the Sahara, or cold, like the
          Gobi. Vegetation is sparse due to the lack of water, and the flora and
          fauna are adapted to conserve moisture and survive extreme temperature
          fluctuations.

            In the desert biome, animals have special adaptations to survive
            extreme heat and dryness. Camels can go without water for long
            periods, storing fat in their humps for energy. The fennec fox has
            large ears that help regulate body temperature and is nocturnal to
            avoid the heat. Rattlesnakes use camouflage and venom to hunt small
            animals. Desert locusts can survive extreme conditions, often
            burrowing to escape the heat. The horned lizard blends into the sand
            and can squirt blood from its eyes as a defense. These animals have
            unique ways of conserving water and staying cool in the harsh desert
            environment.

            Plants in the desert are also adapted to survive with little water.
            Cacti store water in their thick stems and have spines instead of
            leaves to reduce water loss. Creosote bushes have small, waxy leaves
            that help retain moisture. Joshua trees have deep roots to access
            underground water and tough leaves to minimize evaporation.
            Sagebrush is another hardy plant, with a strong aroma and small
            leaves that help it survive the desert's heat and dryness.
