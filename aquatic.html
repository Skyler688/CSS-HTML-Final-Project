      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        An aquatic biome is an ecosystem found in water, either in oceans,
        lakes, rivers, or wetlands. It is characterized by the presence of water
        as the primary habitat for plant and animal life. Aquatic biomes are
        divided into two main types: <span>marine</span> (saltwater) and
        <span>freshwater</span> (rivers, lakes, and ponds). Marine biomes cover
        much of the Earth's surface and include ecosystems like coral reefs and
        open oceans, while freshwater biomes are smaller and include rivers,
        lakes, and wetlands. Both types are rich in biodiversity, supporting a
        wide range of species, from tiny plankton to large whales or freshwater
        fish. The environment in an aquatic biome can vary in terms of
        temperature, light, and salinity, influencing the types of organisms
        that can live there.

        <p>
          In marine aquatic biomes, you'll find animals like fish (such as
          clownfish and tuna), sharks, whales, and sea turtles. Jellyfish,
          octopuses, and crabs are also common in oceans. As for plants, kelp
          forests are a major feature, along with sea grasses and phytoplankton,
          which are essential for marine food chains.
        </p>
        <p>
          In freshwater aquatic biomes, common animals include frogs, freshwater
          fish like bass and trout, beavers, and ducks. Plants in freshwater
          environments include water lilies, cattails, and duckweed, which float
          on the surface of ponds, lakes, and rivers. These plants help provide
          oxygen and shelter for aquatic creatures.
