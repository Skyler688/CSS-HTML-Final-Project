        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          A forest biome is an ecosystem dominated by trees and other
          vegetation, typically with a higher amount of rainfall compared to
          other biomes. There are different types of forest biomes, such as
          tropical rainforests, temperate forests, and boreal forests (taigas).
          These forests are home to a wide variety of plant and animal species,
          with many animals living in the canopy or on the forest floor. Forests
          help regulate the climate by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing
          oxygen, and they play a key role in the water cycle. Forests are found
          in regions with moderate to high rainfall and can vary in temperature
          depending on the type.

            In forest biomes, you'll find a wide variety of both plants and
            animals, each adapted to their specific environment. In temperate
            forests, you might spot animals like deer grazing through the
            underbrush, bears foraging for food, and squirrels darting through
            the trees. These forests often have towering oak trees and lush
            ferns covering the forest floor. In boreal forests (or taigas),
            animals like wolves and moose roam beneath pine trees, while the
            forest floor is often carpeted with mosses and low shrubs. In the
            tropical rainforests, monkeys swing from the dense canopy, and
            insects such as colorful butterflies and beetles buzz about. Tall,
            broad-leaved plants like ferns and tropical flowers thrive here,
            while cacti may be found in tropical dry forests, where rainfall is
            less frequent. Each of these plants and animals plays a vital role
            in maintaining the balance of the forest ecosystem.
