        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
          A grassland biome is an area dominated by grasses and other herbaceous
          plants, with very few trees. It experiences moderate rainfall—more
          than deserts, but less than forests—making it ideal for grasses to
          thrive. The climate typically features hot summers and cold winters,
          with seasonal droughts and occasional fires that help maintain the
          ecosystem. The soil in grasslands is often rich and fertile, which is
          why these areas are commonly used for agriculture. Grasslands are
          found in regions with open spaces and are often characterized by vast,
          rolling plains of grasses and small shrubs. The biome is important for
          carbon storage and soil health.

            In the grassland biome, plant life is dominated by grasses, which
            can grow in tall or short forms depending on the region. You'll find
            bluestem and ryegrass in temperate grasslands, while in tropical
            savannas, lemongrass and elephant grass are common. These grasses
            are well-adapted to droughts, grazing, and fires. Shrubs like
            sagebrush and small trees such as acacias may also be scattered
            across the landscape in some areas.

            As for animals, grasslands support a variety of herbivores like
            bison in North America, zebras in Africa, and antelope in many parts
            of the world. These animals are well-suited for life on the open
            plains, with adaptations for long-distance travel and grazing.
            Grasslands also host smaller creatures like prairie dogs, ground
            squirrels, and a variety of insects, including grasshoppers and
            beetles. Many animals in this biome have evolved to thrive in the
            wide-open spaces and can endure extreme temperature shifts.
